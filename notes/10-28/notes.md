- Past and present
- Project Dragonfly
- Google walkout
- Ethics panel
- Google's response, pushback against ethics panel

- Google exec sexually harasses women
  - Gets 90 million dollars bribe and gets fired
  - People are obviously pissed
- Female Google employees also don't get promoted as much
- Google gets shit on and comes out, meet organizers halfway on their issues.
- Want an end to forced internal arbitration
  - If someone sexually assaults you, you don't go to the police or get a lawyer.
    You have to deal with the company's sexual assault/harassment mediation.
  - Forced internal arbitration is bad because:
    - Not impartial, Google has vested interests

- Meredith Whittaker and Clair Stapleton, the victims, are now being targeted by retaliation
  - Work isn't good enough
  - Team isn't functioning
  - Attitude is bad

- Many other rabblerousers get performance planned (biased performance reviews)

Google employee backlash & Heritage Foundation

- Hosting anti-trans and anti-LGBT stuff
- Appointing transphobes to boards
- Dissolve board immediately

- Girl in class: Ultimately, they don't want people to  ???

- Google didn't switch Kay Cole James out because they want full control over what Google does.
- Google Leadership: This is not a democracy. Mgmt decisions are not up for a popular vote. If you don't like the management board, we'll dissolve it
- This makes them look incompetend and they get dragged.
- This ethics board was not a paid position
- Why did Google like Kay Cole James?
  - Not because they are transphobic
  - "Black woman means progressive"
  - It's because conservative policy can benefit Google
  - Kay Cole sez... "How can Google now expect conservatives to defend it against anti-business policies from the left that might threaten its very existence?"
  - She's saying that people on the left can now tell Google what to do
    - More specifically, it's about REGULATION OF BIG TECH
      - How can we regulate safety?
    - Boeing 747 Max management fuck-up/cover-up, regulation nightmare
  - She would save Google money from having to regulate stuff
  - Now that you've gotten rid of me, you'll be regulated or broken up!
