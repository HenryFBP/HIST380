- Suggestions from Prof. Hicks
- Potentially can use sources that are either very related or directly referenced by one of the above allowed source sources

### In-class on sources
- If you find one or two academic sources that add to your argument very well, it's fine to bring in a secondary source
- Don't rely totally on secondary sources though, def. don't just use Google.

## Main Point

I want to draw evidence that examines how the state of diversity and equality in the workplace has (or hasn't) changed over time.

>> "Workplace equality as a function of time"?

>> "How have various aspects workplace equality (equity?) changed over time in tech jobs?"

Are women treated better?

How have wages changed over time?

Do they report more/less harassment?

How about for black people?

How about for black women?

Is there even data on the subject of how women/black people/black women self-report their workplace conditions back in 1970-1940?
