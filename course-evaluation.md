## Instructor

5/5

Prof. Hicks is a very fair and diplomatic history teacher, esp. given that a large portion of students who go to IIT are not interested in history/social sciences.

She understands the inherent laziness of students who attend classes and structures her class in a way that corrects for that laziness, forcing them to adapt and plan well in advance for their assignments.

She is fair with grading of assignments and does not force her beliefs about structure or rules onto your papers, allowing you to write about a wide range of subjects (within reason).

## Course

5/5

This course is eye-opening to issues that have to do with high tech spaces today.

This course made me realize why "Girls who code" is a movement and how history has affected my field, and why STEM gender/race statistics are god-awful.

I think this course is one of the best HIST courses I've taken at IIT and in my life. It's great, and led by a great instructor. It's impossible not to learn something new in this class.
