Dear Class,

The excerpts from Medical Bondage by Prof. Deirdre Cooper Owens are now live on
Blackboard. FYI: this reading ﻿﻿﻿discusses the development of gynecological
medical science by white doctors who experimented on, and abused, enslaved black
women. It includes detailed and specific discussion of sexual assault, rape, and
brutality. I wanted to give you a quick warning so that you would know in
advance this reading may be disturbing to you.

As you read, consider the other angles from which Prof. Cooper Owens could have
told this story, and the angles from which she chose to tell it. Think about
what her account illuminates about the concept of intersectionality. And also
think about her sources, and the sources that she might've used but that are
missing. What does history this indicate about the history of medical technology
more generally?

Thanks for your essays. There were many interesting ones. I have made a few
public that raised interesting points--feel free to go back and look at them. I
have not many any public that included a disclaimer--if your essay was made
public and you no longer wish it to be, just let me know.

See you Monday,

MH
