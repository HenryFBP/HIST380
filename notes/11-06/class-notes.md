# Class notes for 11-06

# Facebook

* Regulation negatively affects profit
* Implementing fact-checking will cost a lot!
* Don't piss off GOs because they can block your platform and you lose money!# Twitter
* No monetary incentive for Twitter to police russian intel ops/4chan trolls
    - In certain cases they can also say that it doesn't go against TOS# In general
* Monetary incentive: How do I gain money?
* No regulation: I don't want to be regulated and I will support entities that don't regulate me!

I don't think that these are unintended consequences.

Big Tech orgs have a vested monetary interest in keeping their applications open to poor mgmt and no moderation

If they start moderating themselves, they will lose a lot of money.

In order to keep profits, tech companies will keep denying blame and absorbing public shame to delay regulation.

## Girl in x^^^^^ row

* originally though it was unintended

* Maybe twitter wanted to promote stereotypes against Black Women.

    > Why would CCMs ignore the fake black feminist spam?

* One reason is that they need to keep the content popular! Bad press is still press!

## Guy in [x^]^^^ row

* Social media platforms are inherently democratic, and they want to keep it that way

* Things like this are bound to happen

* You can mobilize against shitty things like this

* Necessary evil of having an open platform

## Hicks

* racism means grief on Twitter which means engagement!
