## Submission date

jk its dec 6th 4pm

## Main Point

I want to draw evidence that examines how the state of diversity and equality in the workplace has (or hasn't) changed over time.

>> "Workplace equality as a function of time"?

>> "How have various aspects workplace equality (equity?) changed over time in tech jobs?"

Are women treated better?

How have wages changed over time?

Do they report more/less harassment?

How about for black people?

How about for black women?

Is there even data on the subject of how women/black people/black women self-report their workplace conditions back in 1970-1940?

  About gentrification in bronzeville

  Found in buddy pairing exercise in class

- From note on P2 from Hicks:

  I need more sources about black business owners and how black people were treated in Britain in tech jobs to make the conclusions that I make

  "You'd have to look at a black analogue of Ebony in New Britain"

  - Looking, but IDK if there was a magazine as large as Ebony from what I can find.

    - Found "League of Colored Peoples", an anti-racism organization that existed in Britain, formed in 1940.

    - Still looking. Nothing yet.
