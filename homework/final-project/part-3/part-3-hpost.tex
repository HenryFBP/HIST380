% 'In this paper' is a crappy way of starting. Boring! Change this!!!

	In this paper, I will examine the state of diversity and equality in the workplace in the 2010s onwards, and how that compares to diversity and equality in the 1940s through the 1980s. 
This paper will draw sources %don't like this
from studies that have both quantitative and qualitative content to take full advantage of all available information.

	The purpose of this comparison is to answer the question, ``How has workplace equality changed over time with respect to gender and race?'' Social norms have changed favorably since the 1940s for women and minorities, especially black people, but discrimination certainly still exists in many ways. Some are enforced by society as a whole through popular culture and racist beliefs, but others are enforced through socioeconomic power structures like through workplace discrimination, unfair hiring practices, concentrating wealth, school selection procedures, etc.

The first article I will talk about is a (black guy with the company in boston that hires black workers in 1979) \cite{csc}

- shows USA had some good places that hired black people in late 1970s

- is this just a coincedince? probably not.

>> find another article talking about this guy!!!

- does this show that britain had it a lot worse in terms of how beneficial its job market was to black people in STEM?

>> It certainly suggests that (forgot my train of thought)

>> what if there's just no sources though?

>>> I also had trouble finding ANY articles like Ebony magazine in britain mags or even job postings for black people

The next article\cite{pew} is a meta-analysis %is it tho?
by Pew Social Trends
