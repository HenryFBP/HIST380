	My focus for this part of the assignment was originally going to be foreign students, people of color (POC), and specifically black POC. I wanted to explore the unique relationship that IIT must have with race, racism, and gentrification given its location in Bronzeville, a historically black neighborhood. 

	However, I stumbled upon a few articles that were about homosexuality with wildly different dates, and found a very interesting series of sub-interactions between authors of the papers. I was able to find arguments for and against pro-gay writing, and a very old (1970) article that was pro-gay rights.

	The first article \cite{antigay} I will examine is one written by Jonathan Mikesell for IIT Tech News in 2005. This article is a critique of pro-gay posters/advertisements, and gay culture as a whole. It rebukes the validity of gay struggles and gay rights, and it posits that homosexuality is not a part of identity because homosexuality is essentially fetish for phallic genitalia. The article goes on to reason that because homosexuality is not an intrinsic part of one's identity, homosexuals cannot be oppressed because it is a choice of lust to seek out sexual relations with other men.

	One main point of Mikesell's article is that homosexuals are `opressing themselves'.\footnote{I definitely don't agree with this. I'm just accurately summarizing this guy's argument.} It goes on to say that homosexuality is simply a fetish for penises, and all opression felt by homosexuals is manufactured by them. Because gays manufacture oppression and already have a large amount of social rights, many of their struggles are invalid and a waste of time to pursue.

	MORE OF MIKESELL'S BULLSHIT
	
	This article by Mikesell is obviously inherently inflammatory in the base arguments it supports, and unsurprisingly, two counter-articles were immediately published in next week's publication by two different people.  The first counter-article to Mikesell's article is written by Nadim Haque\cite{counterantigay1}

	I want to examine the interesting differences and similarities between current-day (2019) arguments against gayness or queerness and the positive support gayness had recieved in older articles ( POTATO FINISH THIS PLS :) THX
