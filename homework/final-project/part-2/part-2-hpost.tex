\newpage

In the past, an oxymoron surrounded black women and minority groups in computing: They were both necessary but ignored and underpaid at the same time. Black women were necessary to World War 2, the space race, and supporting governmental financial systems when they worked as calculators, analysts, and mathematicians. The silence was retroactively covered up in some cases when all traces of their existance was willingly withheld.

Similar things can be said of the current state of diversity in technology: Many large companies are oblivious to or actively avoid addressing the problem of diversity in their work environments, especially at high levels of management. There have been various scandals and petitions against high tech companies for unequal treatment of women and people of color (POC) throughout the mid-2000s and especially in recent years.

While searching through Ebony Magazine, I was able to find a good amount of articles involving American companies that were supporting black employees in the workforce. The first one that I found was a Dec 1979 article\cite{csc} that advertised COBOL, FORTRAN, and PASCAL language positions as well as COMTEN, UNIVAC, and IBM 370 machine positions. This was for equal opportunity jobs under the Computer Sciences Corporation, a company who was acquired in 2017 by Hewlett-Packard.

I could find a few places in the London Times that involved women and punchcard operators, but none that were specifically pro-women, and especially none that were pro-black. There did not seem to be a vested interest in including women or black people in computing news or advertisements with the London Times.

I searched for NASA as well as NACA in the London times, but could not find anything other than job postings. The vast majority of computer and tech-related search results that I found in the Times were about female machine operators sought. One that struck me as rather odd was calling for young teenagers to work as machine operators\cite{youngmachineop}.

I was also trying to look for job postings or information specific to wartime or government jobs, but I could find government tax preparation job postings at best. There was one article that actually addresses the 1965 tax computer strikes \cite{taxstrikes} and talks about their escalation.

From the sources I have available, the conclusion I want to make is that it seems that Britain did not make an effort to include women and people of color in its high tech spaces. In fact, it saw the negative effects of not including them as shown in ASFADFSADFSASDFASFDAFSD
