- What's the main argument for each article? 3 lines each.

- After this, what's a major diff b/w 2 or more of these pieces you've read?

  - i.e. Sweeney vs Miley

-----------------------------

# Main arguments

## Noble: Algorithms of oppression

- Google controls search results in its favor, pushing out competitors who
  provide googl-y services favoring entities that will yield money

- By trying to ignore race and culture on the internet, Google will enforce
  racist thinking because ... (unsure)

## Sweeney: Discrimination in Online Ad Delivery

- Google is able to discriminate in its ad delivery based on your name

- Based on the casual names of black peple, google algos bring ups their names
  as criminals, and can cause black ppl not to get hired

## Lesley Miley Articles

- [from girl in class] The tech industry has a lack of diversity because they
  view diversity as a hinderance to progress

- This talks about how he (black dude) worked at Twitter but they laid him off.

  He wanted to quit because of a lack of diversity and lack of Twitter's
  interest in his plans.

  He had a simple plan: Just build a location in a place where black people live!

# Major Differences


## Sweeney vs Miley

- [from girl in class]: Sweeny's article uses qualitative data but Noble's
  article uses mostly quantitative data.

  This is useful to stop people from pandering to quantitative-only research as
  the only 'true' type of research

  Sweeny's research is more specific than Noble's article.

- [from guy in class]: Algorithm is programmed and hiring is not

  [hicks] Sweeney is an outsider to tech and is investigating black-box
  algorithmic results

  Leslie Miley is a tech insider and can see what is being designed into the
  black box.

  Twitter shuts him up because they don't want him talking about what goes on
  in literally any aspect of how he worked at Twitter.
twitter doesn't hire black people
  He refuses to sign an NDA and doesn't get a severance package.

  [guy in class] Sweeney is a researcher and Leslie is a rare black manager at Twitter who says "Twitter doesn't hire black people!!!"


## Noble vs Sweeney

- [from slightly further dude]: Noble says that Google favors its own ads and
  talks about how blackness means different things to different people

  [hicks] Also that this idea of blackness is being constructed by google

- [from same dude]: suppressing black names

  New coffee shop in Bronzeville, but it never shows up on google search results
  because Starbucks gets more clicks!

  [hicks] Story about woman who gets her business destroyed by algorithmic bias

# Can fix it?

Can "Big Tech" fix the problem?

- Miley says yes, you can fix the lack of black people in tech by setting up
  shops in low-income areas!

  He still sees the potential for getting more black people in

- Noble is absolutely 'cannot fix it': Google needs to be regulated, they will
  guzzle ad money until the sun explodes.

- Sweeney says 'tech can fix it' because they can just adjust the algorithm to
  not discriminate against black names in ad searches

# notes lol

UNSAFE AT ANY SPEED: Ralph Nader: American cars are really fucking dangerous!

Silent Spring: Rachel Carson

...

Google's parabolic curve of billions of ad monies has nothing to do with diversity

- Problems are not all one 'problem', but all different and related
  - Unregulated search engines
  - Ad delivery

- Problem is 'something something diversity and tech' from a far-away view

- 2000 feet: Black people being alienated and discriminated against in the
  inputs and outputs of the tech world

  OR:

  Black people are being disproportionately oppressed by new digital tech

- 0 feet view:
  - Discrimination in hiring
  - Algo bias
  - Racist search engines/technology

- Leslie Miley sees really alarming data about how Twitter is handling race
  related data, i.e. they use last names to determine blackness, and Miley tells
  them that slavery fucked up black last names so it can't be used to determine
  if they're black or not.


FOR NEXT CLASS:

Think about these 3 readings as pieces in a puzzle, and the next readings
are puzzle pieces. Try to fit them together and extend this conversation
to a place where we are talking about context that is gonna be used for the end
of the semester.
