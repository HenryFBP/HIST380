# Pre-class

Previous readings as puzzle pieces, current readings as puzzle pieces as well. Do they fit?

* Current readings talk about exploitation of social media to spread disinfo, essentially giant propaganda centers

* Slate article talks about how 4chan trolls and russian counter-intelligence agents are creating fake black profiles to disrupt black people's ability to interpret and respond to social isuses

    - Creating fake black accounts

      May not technically be grounds for acct termination by Twitter

      Black community had to organize against fake black feminist accts by flagging with their own identifiers like #yourslipisshowing

* nbcnews article

  Facebook's platform is used by people to organize genocides

  + They generally ban or flag civilian accts

  + For gov't accts advocating for genocide, they don't do anything.

    - this is because govts may want to block facebook if they can't use it to disseminate propoganda

## The puzzle

I think these readings as well as the previous readings all have to do with **shitty tech regulation**.

When tech platforms like google and fb were young, they really had poor regulation for multiple reasons. I mean, you couldn't even request your data until a few years ago.

The first is that they were young. Why regulate it? In early years, it doesn't make billions of dollars and is maybe only used by a million people.

The second is that there is no necessity to regulate a platform that is young because the scope of harmful effects are negligible if its interests haven't become far too complicated.

But, now regulation of certain aspects of tech platforms is a necessity to avoid blackmailing, fake accounts, acct hijacking, and the spread of harmful propoganda & fake news.
