# Informal notes for part 2

Henry Post, hpost@hawk.iit, HIST 380

## Main Point

I want to draw evidence that examines how the state of diversity and equality in the workplace has (or hasn't) changed over time.

>> "Workplace equality as a function of time"?

Are women treated better?

How have wages changed over time?

Do they report more/less harassment?

How about for black people?

How about for black women?

Is there even data on the subject of how women/black people/black women self-report their workplace conditions back in 1970-1940?
